This Repository holds a project I created to develop a sales and retail database for a company.

The Company is known as Triple S Cosplay and this database handles all the Customers, Orders, Invoices, and Inventory.

Using Stored Procedures and Triggers, I have created ways for information to be inserted into the tables while also automating certain actions.
For example, any updates needed for Orders as Invoices have been created.
